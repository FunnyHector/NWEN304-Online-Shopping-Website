# Vinylholics
"We sell vinyls!"

An online shopping website we created for a course NWEN304. You can browse and search vinyls on the website and create an account to purchase vinyls (No money required).

As an admin you can add new vinyls and artists and edit orders.

## How to run
Just clone the repository, run `npm install` then run `npm start`. From there you can go to http://localhost:8080.

The website is also hosted on Heroku so you can access it here: https://vinylholics.herokuapp.com/
